A vim reference doc based on my .vimrc modifications and personalization.
Including both base vim keybindings, plus personalized keybindings as shown in my .vimrc

---

## Formatting & Visual

```vim

set fo-=r      " Don't auto-comment after <Enter>
set fo-=t      " Don't auto-wrap text
set textwidth=0
set nowrap
set showbreak=‚Ü™\
```

---

## Utilities

```vim
<leader>b      " Base64 decode word under cursor
<leader>g      " Grep word under cursor in project (new tab)
<leader>s      " Sort + dedup buffer lines
```

---

## Compile & Run (F5)

```vim
<F5> compiles and runs current file depending on filetype:

- .c        ‚Üí gcc + time run
- .cpp      ‚Üí g++ + time run
- .java     ‚Üí javac + run
- .sh       ‚Üí bash
- .py       ‚Üí python3
- .go       ‚Üí go build + run
- .html     ‚Üí opens in Firefox
- .mkd      ‚Üí markdown.pl + view
```

---

## Security & Best Practices

```vim
set secure
set modeline
set modelines=5
set nomodelineexpr

" Warn if 'shell' is changed
augroup DetectShellOverride
  autocmd!
  autocmd OptionSet shell if &shell !=# '/bin/bash' |
        \ echomsg '‚ö†Ô∏è  shell modified: ' . &shell |
        \ call writefile([strftime('%F %T') . ' ‚ö†Ô∏è shell modified: ' . &shell],
        \   expand('~/.vim/shell_override.log'), 'a') |
        \ endif
augroup END
```

---

## Modular Filetype Indentation

All indent rules are now offloaded to:
```vim
~/.vim/plugin/filetype-indent_settings.vim
```

See that file for tabstop/shiftwidth settings per filetype: Python, Shell, Vim, Markdown, Rust, Go, etc.

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- `hidden` lets you switch buffers without saving
- `wildmenu` + `wildmode` speeds up command completion
- `CtrlP` + `BufExplorer` = elite buffer/file nav
- `NERDTree` + `TabRepo` keeps projects isolated

---

## Bottom Line

This setup prioritizes:
- Security
- Performance
- Reproducibility
- Project-based workflows

üî• Maintain it like code. Evolve with need. Document intentionally.
